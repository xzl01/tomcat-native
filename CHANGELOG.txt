       IPv4 addresses. (michaelo)

  Changes in 1.2.28

       (csutherl)
     * Fix: Fix a minor memory leak. It occurred every time a TLS connector

     * Fix: Fix some minor memory leaks that could occur after error
       conditions during TLS connector initialisation. (markt)

     * Fix: Fix a thread local key leak. Only relevant when doing
       SSL.initialize() and Library.terminate() a lot of times. (rjung)

  Changes in 1.2.13

     * Fix: Add missing source files to Visual Studio project files. (wrowe)
     * Add: Add support for the OpenSSL SSL_CONF API. (rjung)

       and expand the instructions for building for Windows platforms.

       use of -1 to indicate the full array in File.(read|write)[Full] has
       been removed since it was only partially implemented and the
       implementation was faulty. (markt)
     * Fix: 58082: Update unit tests to use JUnit 4. Refactor unit tests into

     * Update: Update minimum recommended OpenSSL version to 1.0.2k. (markt)

  Changes in 1.2.10

     * Update: Update minimum recommended OpenSSL version to 1.0.2j. (markt)

  Changes in 1.2.9

     * Update: Update minimum recommended OpenSSL version to 1.0.2i. (markt)

       enabled and disabled in the respective Windows binaries. (markt)
     * Fix: Correctly handle OS level EAGAIN return codes during non-blocking
       TLS I/O. (markt)
     * Fix: Correct a potential performance problem identified by Nate Clark
       due to Tomcat Native providing OpenSSL with thread identifiers poorly
       suited to the hash function used by OpenSSL when selecting a bucket
       for the hash that holds the per thread error data. Tomcat Native on
       Windows and on Solaris were not affected. A fix has been applied for
       OSX and Linux. Other platforms may still be affected. (markt/rjung)

  Changes in 1.2.7

     * Update: Update minimum recommended OpenSSL version to 1.0.2h. (markt)

  Changes in 1.2.6

     * Update: Change the OpenSSL version check in configure to be fatal.
       (rjung)

       1.1.0. (rjung)
     * Code: OpenSSL 1.1.0 compatibility updates. (rjung)
     * Fix: Fix some compiler warnings in native ssl code. (rjung)
     * Add: Add support for using Java keystores for certificate chains.
       (markt)
     * Update: Remove the explicit CRL check when verifying certificates. The
       checks were already part of the internal certification verification
       since OpenSSL 0.9.7. Backport from mod_ssl. (rjung)

  Changes in 1.2.5

     * Update: Enable OpenSSL version check in configure by default. It can
       be turned off using --disable-openssl-version-check. (rjung)
     * Fix: 59024: Native function versionString() and for OpenSSL 1.1.0 also
       version() (both in in ssl.c) now return the OpenSSL run time version,
       not the compile time version. (rjung)
     * Code: Track changes in the OpenSSL master branch so it is possible to
       build Tomcat Native with that branch. (billbarker)

  Changes in 1.2.4

     * Fix: SSL.getHandshakeCount(), which was unused, now returns the
       handshake completed count rather than the handshake started count.
       (remm)

  Changes in 1.2.3

     * Fix: Remove Java classes that do not have C implementation code for
       their native methods in the current library. They were used for NPN
       support which is superseded by ALPN support in the current code.
       (kkolinko)
     * Fix: Fix typo in declaration of a stub method used when the library is
       compiled without OpenSSL support. (kkolinko)
     * Fix: Fix the signature of the implementation of the native SSL method
       newSSL() in the case when OPENSSL is not available. (rjung)
     * Fix: Fix the signature of the implementation of the native SSLSocket
       method getInfoB() to return jbyteArray instead of jobject. This is
       consistent with what it actually returns and how the native Java
       method is declared. (rjung)
     * Add: Add support for using Java keystores for certificates and keys.
       (jfclere)
     * Code: Remove code that performs a read after a renegotiation that
       appears to be unnecessary with OpenSSL 1.0.2. (billbarker)
     * Add: Expose SSL_renegotiate to the Java API. (remm)

  Changes in 1.2.2

     * Fix: Fix broken debug and maintainer mode build. (rjung)
     * Fix: Forward port additional fixes to the OpenSSL I/O to align it with
       non-OpenSSL I/O. (markt)

     * Add: Support wakeable pollsets and add Poll.interrupt() API. (mturk)
     * Add: Add Pool.unmanaged() API. (mturk)
     * Update: APIs SSL.generateRSATempKey() and SSL.loadDSATempKey() have
       been removed. (rjung)
